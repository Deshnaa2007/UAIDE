🟢 ETHICAL GENERATIONS (Detectable/Safe):
   These AI-generated images contain visible artifacts that make their synthetic nature apparent:
   • Detectable artifacts protect against successful impersonation
   • Reduced risk for fraud or identity theft
   • Suitable for: Research, education, entertainment, artistic expression
   • Key Requirement: Clear disclosure that content is AI-generated
   
   Recommendation: May be used with proper labeling and consent

🔴 UNETHICAL GENERATIONS (Convincing/Risky):
   These highly realistic AI-generated images lack detectable artifacts:
   • High risk of being mistaken for authentic content
   • Potential for impersonation, fraud, deepfake attacks
   • Unsuitable for: Deception, identity theft, manipulation
   • Critical Risk: Could be used for non-consensual synthetic media
   
   Recommendation: Strict regulatory oversight required. Should require:
     1. Explicit consent from person depicted
     2. Clear technical watermarking
     3. Metadata provenance tracking
     4. Platform enforcement against misuse
     5. Legal accountability for creator

📋 BEST PRACTICES FOR RESPONSIBLE AI IMAGE GENERATION:

1. DISCLOSURE & TRANSPARENCY
   ☑ Always clearly label AI-generated content with visible markers
   ☑ Include metadata indicating generation method
   ☑ Support industry standards (C2PA Content Authenticity Initiative)
   ☑ Use digital watermarks/fingerprints

2. CONSENT & PERMISSIONS
   ☑ Obtain explicit written consent before generating images of real people
   ☑ Verify identity of consent provider
   ☑ Document consent for legal protection
   ☑ Prohibit non-consensual synthetic media creation

3. LEGAL COMPLIANCE
   ☑ Comply with deepfake, synthetic media, and identity fraud laws
   ☑ Understand jurisdiction-specific regulations
   ☑ Maintain audit logs of all creations
   ☑ Implement content moderation

4. TECHNICAL SAFEGUARDS
   ☑ Build in visible artifacts (limit convincingness)
   ☑ Embed consent information in metadata
   ☑ Use cryptographic signatures for authenticity
   ☑ Support detection and verification tools
   ☑ Implement rate limiting for mass generation

5. GOVERNANCE & ACCOUNTABILITY
   ☑ Establish ethical review boards
   ☑ Monitor for policy violations
   ☑ Report misuse to authorities
   ☑ Support victims of non-consensual synthetic media
   ☑ Regular audits and compliance checks

⚖️ LEGAL IMPLICATIONS:

Unethical AI-generated images may violate laws regarding:
   • Identity fraud and impersonation
   • Harassment and defamation
   • Deepfake regulations (increasingly common globally)
   • Non-consensual intimate imagery
   • Intellectual property rights
   • Platform terms of service
   
Creators and distributors may face:
   • Criminal prosecution
   • Civil litigation
   • Platform bans
   • Financial penalties
   • Reputation damage

📊 ANALYSIS RESULTS INTERPRETATION:

The findings show that {ec} images ({ep:.1f}%) are relatively safe due to 
detectable artifacts, while {uc} images ({up:.1f}%) pose significant ethical risks 
due to their convincing nature. This suggests:""".replace("{ec}", str(ethical_count)).replace("{ep}", ethical_count/len(df)*100).replace("{uc}", str(unethical_count)).replace("{up}", unethical_count/len(df)*100)
